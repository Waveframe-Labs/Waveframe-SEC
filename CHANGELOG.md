This release establishes Glyphtrace as an open symbolic epistemic compression framework under
Waveframe Labs. v0.0.1 delivers the initial structural scaffold including core documentation,
early specification draft, converter sketch, and conceptual foundations. This marks the first
stable archival checkpoint for future grammar definition, example expansion, and tooling integration.

Future work:
- Define symbolic grammar
- Produce example round‑trip traces
- Formal converter and CLI/LLM interface
